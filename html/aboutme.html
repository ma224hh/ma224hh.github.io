        <p id="introduction">Hello! My name is Mona, I am from Germany and I currently live in Växjö, because I 
            do an Erasmus semester here. At Linneuniversitetet I study Computer Science with 
            focus on web development, although in Germany I actually study Bioinformatics. 
            But since I always thought about studying Computer Science, I will leave out the 
            Biology part for this semester and look forward to receiving some practical and
            useful information about Web development. And since I am very much into travelling, 
            I'd like to use this semester to experience as many places in Scandinavia as possible.
            And this is what this site will mainly be about. I hope you have fun!
        </p>
        <h3>Travelling</h3>
        <div id="travelling">My travelling journey began as a <strong>child</strong>, when my parents took me to 
            a lot of places in Europe for vacation. This went on for several years, until I 
            was old enough to travel alone and I started exploring Europe with my friends and 
            also on my own. 
        </div>
        <h4>Countries I already visited</h4>
        <ul>
                <li>Germany (of course)</li>
                <li>Austria</li>
                <li>Turkey</li>
                <li>Belgium</li>
                <li>Greece</li>
                <li>Italy</li>
        </ul> 
        <div id="traveleurope">As you can see in the list, I had already been to almost every part of Europe
            except northern and eastern Europe, and that's why I decided to study in Scandinavia 
            for a few months and continue my journey there. <br /> <br /> 
        </div>
        <h4>Travel destinations during the exchange semester</h4>
        <p id="travelscandinavia">As I said, I want to explore Scandinavia during my time in Sweden. Some travels are 
            already planned or have already been taking place by the time this website is 
            published. Here you can find the cities and regions that I have already written 
            in my calendar (ordered by time):
        </p>
        <ol>
                <li>Göteborg</li>
                <li>Vimmerby</li>
                <li>Stockholm</li>
                <li>Oslo</li>
                <li>Lapland</li>
        </ol>
        <div id="quidditch">But travelling is not the only thing I am passionate about.
            What currently takes all my free time is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(sport)">Quidditch</a>
            . Exactly, this is the sport from Harry Potter, brought to real life. Here is a video, that shows 
            how this sport works: <video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocy9uXXDE8M&t=109s" width="320" height="240" controls>
