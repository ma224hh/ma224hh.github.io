                <p id=description> My blog is about my main love: Quidditch. Here you can find 
                    articles about teams, tournaments, rules and the great people that are 
                    involved in this sport.

                        <h2> Quidditch </h2>
                        Quidditch is a sport of two teams of seven players each mounted on 
                        broomsticks played on a hockey rink-sized pitch. <br />It is based on a 
                        fictional game of the same name invented by author J. K. Rowling, which 
                        is featured <br />in the Harry Potter series of novels and related media.
                         The game is also sometimes referred to <br />as muggle quidditch to 
                         distinguish it from the fictional game which involves magical elements 
                         <br />such as flying broomsticks and enchanted balls. In the Harry Potter
                          universe,<br /> a "muggle" is a person without magic blood.<br /><br />
                        
                        The pitch is rectangular with rounded corners 55 metres (60 yards) 
                        by 33 metres (36 yards) <br />with three hoops of varying heights at either end.
                        The sport was created in 2005 <br />and is therefore still quite young. However,
                         quidditch is played around the world and actively growing.<br />
                          The ultimate goal is to have more points than the other team 
                          by the time the snitch, <br />a tennis ball inside a long sock hanging 
                          from the shorts of an impartial official dressed in yellow, is caught.<br /> 
                          Rules of the sport are governed by the International Quidditch 
                          Association, <br />or the IQA, and events are sanctioned by either the
                           IQA or that nation's governing body.<br /><br />
                        
                        To score points, chasers or keepers must get the quaffle, a slightly
                         deflated volleyball, <br />into one of three of the opposing hoops which scores
                          the team 10 points. To impede the quaffle from advancing down the 
                          pitch,<br /> chasers and keepers are able to tackle opposing chasers and keepers
                          <br />at the same time as beaters using their bludgers—dodgeballs—to take out
                            opposing players. Once a player is hit by an opposing bludger,<br />
                             that player must dismount their broom, drop any ball being held, and 
                             return to and touch their hoops <br />before being allowed back into play.
                             The game is ended once the snitch is caught by one of the seekers, 
                             awarding that team 30 points.<br /><br />
                        
                        A team consists of minimum seven (maximum 21) players, of which six are
                         always on the pitch, those being the three chasers, one keeper, and two
                          beaters. Besides the seeker who is off-pitch, the six players are required
                           to abide by the gender rule, which states that a team may have a maximum 
                           of four players who identify as the same gender, excluding the seeker,
                            making quidditch one of the few sports that not only offers a co-ed 
                            environment but an open community to those who do not identify with the 
                            gender binary. Matches or games often run about 30 to 40 minutes but 
                            tend to be subject to varying lengths of time due to the unpredictable 
                            nature of the snitch catch. If the score at the end of the match including 
                            the 30 point snitch catch is tied (such that the team that caught the 
                            snitch was 30 points behind the other), the game moves to overtime where 
                            the snitch is constrained to the pitch's dimensions and the game ends 
                            after five minutes or when the snitch is legally caught.
